Tests of seasonality
====================

Seasonality can manifest itself in timeseries data in unexpected ways. Sometimes
trends are partially dependent on the time of year or month. Other times, they
may be related to weather patterns. In either case, seasonality is a real consideration
that must be made. The pyramid package provides a test of seasonality for including
seasonal terms in your ARIMA models.
